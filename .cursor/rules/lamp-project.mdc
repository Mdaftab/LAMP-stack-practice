# LAMP Stack Project Rules

## Project Context

This is a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) demo project for learning purposes. All components run in a single Docker container.

## Key Files Reference

- `docker/Dockerfile` - Single-container LAMP setup
- `app/config.php` - Database connection settings
- `app/index.php` - Main PHP application
- `Taskfile.yml` - Task automation commands
- `requirment.txt` - Project requirements

## Development Guidelines

### PHP Code

- Use `mysqli_*` functions for MySQL connectivity
- Always escape user input with `mysqli_real_escape_string()`
- Use `htmlspecialchars()` when outputting user data to HTML
- Include detailed comments explaining each code block

### Docker

- Keep all services in the single-container approach
- Use Supervisor to manage multiple processes
- Mount `app/` directory for live development
- Preserve MySQL data with named volumes

### Taskfile Commands

Standard commands: `task up`, `task down`, `task logs`, `task shell`, `task mysql`

### Documentation

- Add educational comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Keep code beginner-friendly with clear explanations
- Update README.md when adding new features
